      <h5>Javascript's overloaded '+' operator.</h5>
     <p>In javascript, the <span class="code">+</span> operator serves as both an actual arithmetic + operator and a string concatenation operator. <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.6.1">The spec</a> for this actually makes a lot of sense, and boils down to "evaluate the left and right expressions; if one (or both) is a string then treat them both as strings and concatenate them, otherwise treat them both as numbers and try to add them."</p>
     <p>Pretty straightforward, right? <span class="code">1 + 1 = 2</span> and <span class="code">1 + "1" = "11"</span>. When arithmetic operations are chained they evaluate from left to right, so <span class="code">1 + 2 + "3" = "33"</span>.</p>
     <p>Things get a little zany when you mix in javascript's type coercion. Arrays count as strings: <span class="code">1 + [] = "1"</span>, as do objects: <span class="code">1 + {} = "1object Object"</span>. Booleans are, predictably, numbers: <span class="code">1 + true = 2</span> (and <span class="code">true + true = 2</span> - treat everything as a number unless a string shows up), and null is, well, null: <span class="code">1 + null = 1</span>. Rounding out the built-in types, <span class="code">1 + undefined = NaN</span> -
     not wholly surprising, though I had expected it to behave more like null.</p>
     <p>Mixing types gets more confusing. <span class="code">1 + [1] = "11"</span> because the array is considered a string and its contents are cast to a string, including the commas: <span class="code">1 + [1,1] = "11,1"</span> - unless the contents are null or undefined: <span class="code">1 + [null] = "1"</span>, <span class="code">1 + [undefined] = "1"</span>. Despite being considered a string when paired with a number - again, <span class="code">1 + {} = "1object
       Object"</span> - objects sometimes act like numbers: <span class="code">{} + null = 0</span>, and <span class="code">{} + undefined = NaN</span>.</p>
     <p>Because they're not overloaded, the other arithmetic operators do their best to treat both sides of an expression as a number. So <span class="code">"1" + 1 = "11"</span>, but <span class="code">"1" - 1 = 0</span>. Every built-in type except for object (which throws a SyntaxError) reacts like a number when met with '-', '*', or '/', including array, which casts to 0 unless it contains something: <span class="code">[] * 1 = 0</span>, <span class="code">["1"] * 2 = 2</span>.
     <span class="code">[{}] * 1 = NaN</span>, of course, because... the object gets cast to undefined? But <span class="code">[{}] + 1 = "[object Object]1"</span>. Okay, I have a nosebleed. We're done here.
     </p>
     <p>My point is, dynamic typing + overloaded arithmetic operators give me a headache. As an exercise to the reader, I leave the following: <span class="code">["10"]/(true+true) = ?</span>. Next week, why <span class="code">NaN !== NaN</span> (I'm kidding please no more).</p>

        <h5>Abusing the HTML5 History API</h5>
        <p>
          Everyone agrees <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content">FOUC</a> is bad, but lately I've been opposed to any sort of visible flash while changing pages on a single domain (unless there's meant to be a context change). I'm not sure if this feeling is driven by some nostalgia for the animated-transition-laden flash sites of my youth, or in spite of them - either way, it's strange to me to still be loading whole new pages with 40% repeated content almost a decade after AJAX became a buzzword.
          </p>
          <p>Using AJAX was my first thought, but just loading in new content and popping it into parts of the page fails to update the url. I could update <span class="code">location.href</span>, but that forces a page load. We could update <span class="code">location.hash</span> - that doesn't force a reload - but that leaves an unsightly hash in the url, which gives it the feel of a jump anchor - which, in a way, it is -  but that's not how I want to present it to users.</p>
          <p>
          Enter the HTML5 History API. The <span class="code">history</span> object stores state info for the pages you've visited in a given tab, and allows you to both navigate between states and push a new state (or replace the current one) - the trick here being that pushing/replacing a state updates the url in the browser to read however you want it to (after the hostname) without forcing a reload.  
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="code">history.pushState</span> takes three arguments:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A <span class="code">state</span> object, which can contain whatever data you want - including just being a string, if that's what you're into. Navigating between states fires a <span class="code">popstate</span> event that includes the state object, so depending on how you use the API and how much data you need to pass between states, this is a potential alternative to <span class="code">localStorage</span></li>
            <li>A <span class="code">title</span> object - the docs say it's looking for a string, but as far as I can tell this arg still isn't being used anywhere. All four major browsers (tested on Windows and Linux, at least) display the page's actual <span class="code">title</span> tag in the history.</li>
            <li>The <span class=code>URL</span> you want to use. It can be relative.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>That's great, how are you actually using it?</em> At the moment this site is a single page dressed up as a multi-page site by selectively showing content based on the url. Navigation consisits of normal anchor links with hrefs pointing to #ids on the page. When one is clicked, that section is displayed, the others are hidden, and an updated URL is pushed to the history. Like I mentioned above, updating the url via the history API doesn't refresh the page, so there is
          only the single
          page to worry about loading and painting. The same index page is served up as both the root and 404 pages, and then a router reads the path and displays the appropriate section (including one for 404s, if necessary).</p>
          <p>This solution isn't all great - for one thing, everything is currently dumped into one giant HTML file. This makes updating the blog a bit ponderous, and will potentially lead to loading speed issues once the file grows large enough. Also, while the CSS is designed to turn the page into one long one-pager and the anchors will still work without JS, the routing is nonfunctional without javascript enabled. The first problem could be solved by switching from a true one-pager to
          dynamically loading the content with ajax while keeping the rest of the page static and retaining the history API use.</p><p>Of course, a week from now I'll probably just rebuild this whole site in Angular, or something.</p>

        I went on a military sci-fi kick early in the year, which culminated in devouring entirely more 40k novels than I'd care to admit. I don't play Warhammer, but I think the universe is neat and - credit where it's due - Dan Abnett is a fine author. 
        </p>
        <p>Dune was my favorite new read of the year - I remember failing to get past the first page in high school, but I borrowed it from a friend in June and read it twice in about a week.</p>
        <p>Only two technical books made the list, partially because I wasn't in the habit of reading technical books until recently and partially because I have another three which are nearly finished and will make the 2014 list. Goal this year: more technical books, less genre fiction.</p>
